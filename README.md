## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a passionate backend developer specialized in the **.NET ecosystem**, with strong foundations in **Clean Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture, and SOLID principles**. My main focus is building **robust, scalable, and maintainable applications** that go far beyond CRUD — systems where every design decision improves flexibility, performance, and long-term value.

Curious and self-taught, I love exploring **emerging technologies** such as Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing, while constantly refining my skills in **software architecture, API design, and database optimization**.

### **CunDropShipping – E-Commerce Microservices System**
A modular e-commerce platform built under **Clean Architecture principles** and designed as a set of **scalable microservices**.  
Each microservice is responsible for a core domain (Products, Shipments, Payments, etc.), ensuring maintainability, scalability, and clear separation of concerns.

#### 🔹 Key Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: Independent, decoupled services for core business areas.
- **Clean Architecture & DDD**: Robust design focused on maintainability.
- **.NET Core + EF Core + MySQL**: Modern backend stack ensuring scalability and performance.
- **Git Flow Workflow**: Structured version control for collaborative development.

#### 📂 Current Microservices
- **[Product API](https://github.com/TomyEsqper/CunDropShipping-ProductApi)** → Handles product catalog management, CRUD operations, and inventory logic.
- **[Shipments API](https://github.com/TomyEsqper/CunDropShipping-ShipmentsApi)** → Manages logistics, shipping orders, and delivery tracking.

#### 🚀 Roadmap
- **Payments API** → Secure transactions and billing.
- **Users API** → Authentication, authorization, and user management.
- **Orders API** → Order placement, status tracking, and history.
